This chapter explores the process of learning how the human brain functions. It discusses how we should learn about the human brain so that the inventions created can better assist humans. It mentions a lot about how humans often try to compromise when they make errors, and people blame themselves a lot, but that could be due to bad design.

It is true that it is easy for people to blame everyone and everything when things don't go right. When things were wrong, people tend to find something to take the blame. I remember telling my aunt about how my sneaker's shoe pad had a hole drilled in there due to friction. She said it is probably because I am too violent on that shoe. But a sneaker is used for exercise, how would I be in fault when I use it for exercise and the center of gravity makes my foot drill a hole on the shoe pad. I don't think I can be "more gentle" when the material is clearly not strong enough for how the feet work in there.
