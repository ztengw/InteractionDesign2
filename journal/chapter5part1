### PART 1

People make mistakes due to interruptions, and they have to determine the main cause of the error. With that, Don Norman mentioned "The Five Whys," that is developed by Sakichi Toyoda. However, this is just a suggestion; it does not guarantee success. People need to learn to stop self-blame, as it could have been fixed if pointed out. Sometimes it's just bad design.

Deliberate Violation: Sometimes, people risk doing something and get rewarded when they get a good result; if not, they get punished. But it is important to take the risks to get work done. It is always critical to make mistakes to know what is wrong.

#### There are two types of errors: Slips and Mistakes. 

Slips occur when the goal is correct but the required actions aren't done correctly, resulting in poor execution. There are two classes of slips: Action-based and memory lapse.
Action-based: A person wants to do A but ends up doing B instead.
Memory lapse: A person forgets to do something.

Mistakes happen when the goal or plan is wrong. Mistakes have three major classes: rule-based, knowledge-based, and memory-lapse.
Rule-based: When people have correctly recognized the problem but have chosen the wrong method of action, which is, they are following the wrong rule.
Knowledge-based: People are misdiagnosed due to inaccurate or insufficient information.
Memory-lapse: When goals, plans, or evaluations are neglected.

Checklists can be very helpful for any slips.
