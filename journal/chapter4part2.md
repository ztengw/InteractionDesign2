### PART 2

Forcing function is a constraint that restrains inappropriate behavior. And in the field of engineering, it can be separated into three methods: interlocks, lock-ins, and lockouts. 

Interlocks are mechanisms that ensure machinery functions in the correct sequence or prevent the machine from working for safety purposes.

Lock-ins holds someone in the spot or stops an action until the planned actions are performed.

A lockout keeps someone from entering a risky area or stops an event from happening, usually for safety reasons.

In part two, Don Norman mentioned that when new things comes, people rejects to accept or learn it. That could relate to the cases of AI that's attacking us. I myself also am not entirely accepting them yet, as they are definitely stealing jobs. 

Using sound as signifiers, could be helpful as it can provide people the information to know if they are using the things correctly or not.
