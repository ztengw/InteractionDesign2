I think that the part where he mentions a washing-dryer combination with a lot of multi-symbol controls, starting from page 8, on the topic of frustration in everyday life, resonates with me. There are often numerous settings on some of the electrical appliances at home, but you rarely use them. For instance, some extra functions on the TV, different dishwasher modes, and many more. 

Feedback is definitely a great way to improve, and I definitely agree on the part where the author mentioned that the "modern telephone systems are difficult to learn due to having more features and less feedback which was mentioned on page 27 on the topic of "Principle of Feedback". I feel that the setting is very difficult to use because sometimes, even with the search navigation, I still couldn't exactly pin down the things I need to find on my phone. I wish there were an AI that could help me in the app, so it wouldn't take me too much time to find the system I am looking for.
